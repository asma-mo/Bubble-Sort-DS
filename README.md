In our time، the online shopping has became an integral part of our life and our reliance on online shopping has increased more than we had imagined. One of the simplest and most important things every programmer should know is how to create a website or website basis for an online store, regardless of the type of store.

In our program that is built entirely on c++ without calling any libraries or use any interfaces. 
We built a store “grocery” and calculate the total and use a discount coupon and other additions will be clear when you run the program. 
We have provided a complete basic form similar to what is found in most online stores.
With our reliance on the most important concepts of data structure sorting techniques and use the most popular.. bubble sort with search functions similar to searching techniques. The program is built with least possible time complexity in an attractive and tidy manner

NOTE: the program idea is a original idea and built entirely from the start to the end by students
